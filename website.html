                Our team was tasked with creating a website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We started by learning the basics of each language through dedicated courses. Once equipped with the necessary skills, we proceeded to build the website.

The process began with structuring the content using HTML, ensuring clarity and accessibility. We then used CSS to style the pages, focusing on creating an attractive and user-friendly design. JavaScript was integrated to add interactive elements, such as forms and responsive features.

Throughout development, we conducted regular testing to ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices. Any issues that arose were promptly addressed through debugging and refinement.

After concerted efforts, we successfully crafted a functional and visually appealing website that showcases our proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
